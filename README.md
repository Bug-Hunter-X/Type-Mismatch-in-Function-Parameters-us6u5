# TypeScript Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in TypeScript. The `add` function expects two numerical parameters; however, the code attempts to pass a string, resulting in a compilation error.

The solution showcases a type guard implementation to verify that the second parameter is a number before the addition operation.
